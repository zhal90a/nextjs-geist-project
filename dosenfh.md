2. **Portrait Photos**: All profile images now use `aspect-[3/4]` instead of fixed heights
3. **Consistency**: Applied portrait mode across all components (grids and detail pages)
4. **Responsive Design**: Maintained responsive behavior with new aspect ratios

## Testing Results:
✅ **Layout Positioning**: TendikGrid successfully moved below DosenGrid
✅ **Portrait Mode**: All profile photos (Dosen & Tendik) display in 3:4 portrait aspect ratio
✅ **Grid Layout**: Both grids maintain clean, professional appearance
✅ **Detail Pages**: Individual profile pages show portrait photos correctly
